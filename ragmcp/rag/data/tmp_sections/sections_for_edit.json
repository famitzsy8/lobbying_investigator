    "text": "SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\nCongress finds the following:\n(1) The populations of several species of wildlife across\nAmerica are in crisis. The Nation's efforts to recover at-risk\nwildlife populations are not keeping pace with the increased\ndemand for natural resources and threats to native wildlife,\nincluding disease, invasive species, habitat loss and\nfragmentation, shifts in temperature ranges, and extreme\nweather. More than 150 species are presumed extinct, another\n500 are likely extinct, and more than 12,000 species are\ndesignated as species of greatest conservation need, including\nmore than 700 wildlife species in the United States that are\nalready listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered\nSpecies Act. An assessment of the best-known groups of United\nStates wildlife and plants indicates that one-third of\nAmerica's species are vulnerable to extinction and one-fifth\nimperiled and at high-risk of extinction.\n(2) A diverse array of species of fish and wildlife is of\nsignificant value to the United States for aesthetic,\necological, educational, cultural, recreational, economic, and\nscientific reasons.\n(3) More than 100 million citizens of the United States\nparticipate in outdoor recreation through hunting, fishing,\nbirding, and other wildlife-dependent recreation, all of which\nhave significant value to the citizens who engage in those\nactivities and provide economic benefits to local communities.\n(4) It is in the interest of the United States--\n(A) to retain for present and future generations\nthe opportunity to hunt, fish, observe, understand, and\nappreciate a wide variety of fish and wildlife;\n(B) to recover species of fish and wildlife listed\nas threatened species or endangered species under the\nEndangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.)\nand to prevent fish and wildlife species from declining\nto the point of requiring Federal protection under such\nAct; and\n(C) to support collaborative and proactive\nconservation that will sustain the diverse fish and\nwildlife populations of the United States.\n(5) The first nongovernmental conservation organizations to\ninstill fish and wildlife conservation values in hunters,\nanglers, bird watchers, and all citizens were founded during\nthe 1880s to 1890s at the behest of hunters and anglers,\nincluding Theodore Roosevelt and naturalist George Bird\nGrinnell, who were alarmed that game and sportfish could not\nsustain unregulated harvest and that avifauna needed protection\nfrom commercial take.\n(6) At the turn of the 20th century, the States--\n(A) realized the need to regulate the harvest of\ngame and sportfish for sustainable use;\n(B) required hunters and anglers to obtain licenses\nand established regulations for game seasons, bag and\ncreel limits, and legal means of take for game and\nsportfish; and\n(C) used the funds received for such licenses\nlargely for enforcement of such regulations.\n(7) In 1937, an alliance between hunters and conservation\norganizations, States, the Federal Government, and the shooting\nsports industry convinced Congress to transfer to the States\nreceipts from an existing Federal excise tax on sporting arms\nand ammunition, matched by State hunting license dollars, for\nthe management of wildlife and conservation of habitat under\nthe Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act (16 U.S.C. 669\net seq.), which greatly enhanced the States' ability to move\nfrom primarily enforcing game seasons and bag limits to\nscience-based research and management of wildlife.\n(8) In 1951, an alliance between anglers and conservation\norganizations, States, the Federal Government, and the\nsportfishing industry convinced Congress to impose a Federal\nexcise tax on fishing equipment under the Dingell-Johnson\nSportfish Restoration Act (16 U.S.C. 777 et seq.) and to\ntransfer to the States such receipts, matched by State fishing\nlicense revenues, to manage sportfish and conserve aquatic\nhabitats, enhancing the State fish and wildlife department's\nability to use science-based research and management of fish\nspecies.\n(9) Such user-pay, public-benefits means of funding fish\nand wildlife conservation are unique in the world, having been\nstarted in the United States by sportsmen and sportswomen who\nwere willing to pay these fees to ensure dedicated funds went\nto fish and wildlife conservation delivered by the States.\n(10) Such user-pay funds (licenses and excise taxes)--\n(A) have benefitted not only hunters and anglers,\nbut all citizens of the United States by providing\nabundant fish and wildlife (including both game and\nnongame species), clean water, outdoor recreation,\nhealthy activities, and quality of life; and\n(B) provide, and will continue to provide, a\nmajority of the funds that are available to State fish\nand wildlife departments for science-based research and\nmanagement of fish and wildlife.\n(11) State fish and wildlife agencies are responsible for\nthe conservation and management of all fish and wildlife in the\nState, but are grossly underfunded because there are few funds\navailable at the State level for fish and wildlife\nconservation, except those driven by hunting and fishing\nlicense revenues and Federal excise tax revenues.\n(12) Congress created a subaccount known as the Wildlife\nConservation and Restoration Subaccount under section 3(a)(2)\nof the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act (16 U.S.C.\n669b(a)(2)) to support the full array of fish and wildlife\nconservation needs identified by State fish and wildlife\ndepartments, including for species that are not hunted or\nfished, but only authorized appropriations for the Subaccount\nfor one year.\n(13) While some appropriated funds have been made available\nthrough related programs, the lack of assured and sufficient\ndedicated funding for the Wildlife Conservation and Restoration\nSubaccount has left unrealized the goals of the Subaccount,\nthereby allowing fish and wildlife populations to continue to\ndecline across the United States and resulting in hundreds of\nspecies being listed as threatened species or endangered\nspecies under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C.\n1531 et seq.).\n(14) Under the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act\n(16 U.S.C. 669 et seq.), each State and territory is required\nto seek public input and produce a comprehensive fish and\nwildlife conservation strategy, otherwise known as a State\nWildlife Action Plan, to guide the State-led conservation of\nthe full array of fish, wildlife, and their habitats.\n(15) Providing assured and sufficient dedicated funding to\nthe Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Subaccount will\nadvance the national interest by assuring sustainable\npopulations of fish and wildlife species are available for the\nuse and enjoyment of citizens of the United States through\nimplementing the comprehensive fish and wildlife conservation\nstrategy of each State, territory, and the District of\nColumbia.\nTITLE I--WILDLIFE CONSERVATION AND RESTORATION"
