IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
March 9, 2021
Mr. Whitehouse (for himself, Mr. Booker, and Mr. Schatz) introduced the
following bill; which was read twice and referred to the Committee on
Environment and Public Works
_______________________________________________________________________
A BILL
To require the Secretary of the Treasury to levy a fee on methane
emissions from oil and natural gas facilities, and for other purposes.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ``Methane Emissions Reduction Act of
2021''.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds that--
(1) methane is a potent heat-trapping gas that absorbs 28
to 36 times the quantity of energy that carbon dioxide absorbs
over a 100-year period;
(2) increased methane concentrations in the atmosphere are
responsible for approximately 25 percent of observed global
warming;
(3) approximately \1/3\ of global anthropogenic methane
emissions are produced by the production and transmission of
fossil fuels;
(4) recent estimates suggest that methane emissions from
oil and natural gas operations in the United States are 60
percent higher than previously believed, representing 2.3
percent of natural gas production;
(5) methane emissions from oil and natural gas operations
in the United States represent approximately $2,000,000,000 in
lost natural gas that could be used to fuel 10,000,000 homes;
(6) estimates from the International Energy Agency suggest
that \1/2\ of methane emissions from global oil and natural gas
supply chains may be eliminated at zero net cost;
(7) some oil and natural gas companies have announced plans
to reduce methane emissions from the operations of those
companies to below 0.2 percent of production, demonstrating
that significant reductions in methane emissions are
technically and economically feasible; and
(8) numerous companies in the United States are developing
innovative technologies to allow oil and natural gas companies
to more cost-effectively detect and reduce methane emissions.
SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
In this Act:

(as defined by the American Association of Petroleum
Geologists).
(2) Empirically determined.--The term ``empirically

estimating the quantity of methane emissions from a basin.
(3) Methane.--The term ``methane'' means a chemical
compound with the chemical formula CH<INF>4</INF>.

the release of methane from the extraction, production,
gathering, processing, compression, transmission, or storage
of--
(A) oil; or
(B) natural gas.
(5) Methane fee factor.--The term ``methane fee factor''
means the amount calculated under section 4(b)(2)(D) for the
applicable calendar year.
(6) Natural gas.--The term ``natural gas'' has the meaning
given the term in section 3 of the Deepwater Port Act of 1974
(33 U.S.C. 1502).

multiplying--
(aa) the difference
between--
(AA) the percentage
of volume lost to the
atmosphere in the basin
during the calendar
year; and
(BB) 0.2 percent;
(bb) the total quantity of
natural gas produced or
released and lost to the
atmosphere during oil or
natural gas production by the
company in the basin during the
calendar year; and
(cc) the methane fee factor
for the applicable calendar
year; and
(II) the product obtained by
