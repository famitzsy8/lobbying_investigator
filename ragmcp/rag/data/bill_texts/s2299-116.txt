ensuring proper pressure controls and have the
capability to promptly shut down the flow of gas or
control over pressurization at a district regulator
station during any construction project that has the
potential to cause a hazardous overpressurization at
that station, including tie-ins and abandonment of
distribution lines and mains, based on an evaluation,
conducted by the operator, of threats that could result
in unsafe operation.
``(B) Exclusion.--In promulgating regulations under
subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall ensure that those

date of enactment of this subsection, the Secretary
shall promulgate regulations to require that each
operator of a distribution system assesses and
upgrades, as appropriate, each district regulator
station of the operator to ensure that--

distribution system exceeding, by a common mode
of failure, the maximum allowable operating
pressure (as described in section 192.623 of
title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (or a
successor regulation)) allowed under Federal
law (including regulations) is minimized;
``(ii) the gas pressure of a low-pressure
distribution system is monitored, particularly
at or near the location of critical pressure-
control equipment;
``(iii) the regulator station has secondary
or backup pressure-relieving or overpressure-
protection safety technology, such as a relief
valve or automatic shutoff valve, or other
pressure-limiting devices appropriate for the
configuration and siting of the station and, in
the case of a regulator station that employs
the primary and monitor regulator design, the
operator shall eliminate the common mode of
failure or provide backup protection capable of
either shutting the flow of gas, relieving gas
to the atmosphere to fully protect the
distribution system from overpressurization
events, or there must be technology in place to
eliminate a common mode of failure; and
``(iv) if the Secretary determines that it
is not operationally possible for an operator
to implement the requirements under clause
(iii), the Secretary shall require such
operator to identify actions in their plan that
minimize the risk of an overpressurization
event.''.
