SEC. 412. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON THE NEED FOR A NEW GREAT LAKES
ICEBREAKER.
(a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
(1) The Great Lakes shipping industry is crucial to the
American economy, including the U.S. manufacturing base,
providing important economic and national security benefits.
(2) A recent study found that the Great Lakes shipping
industry supports 237,000 jobs and tens of billions of dollars
in economic activity.
(3) United States Coast Guard icebreaking capacity is
crucial to full utilization of the Great Lakes shipping system,
as during the winter icebreaking season up to 15 percent of
annual cargo loads are delivered and many industries would have
to reduce their production if Coast Guard icebreaking services
were not provided.
(4) Six of the Coast Guard's nine icebreaking cutters in
the Great Lakes are more than 30 years old and are frequently
inoperable during the winter icebreaking season, including
those that have completed a recent service life extension
program.
(5) During the previous 10 winters, Coast Guard Great Lakes
icebreaking cutters have been inoperable for an average of 65
cutter-days during the winter icebreaking season, with this
annual lost capability exceeding 100 cutter-days, with a high
of 246 cutter-days during the winter of 2017-2018.
(6) The 2019 ice season provides further proof that current
Coast Guard icebreaking capacity is inadequate for the needs of
the Great Lakes shipping industry, as only six of the nine
icebreaking cutters are operational and millions of tons of
cargo was not loaded or was delayed due to inadequate Coast
Guard icebreaking assets during a historically average winter
for Great Lakes ice coverage.
(7) The Congress has authorized the Coast Guard to acquire
a new Great Lakes icebreaker as capable as Coast Guard Cutter
MACKINAW (WLBB-30), the most capable Great Lakes icebreaker,
and $10 million has been appropriated to fund the design and
initial acquisition work for this icebreaker.
(8) The Coast Guard has not initiated a new acquisition
program for this Great Lakes icebreaker.
(b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress of the
United States that a new Coast Guard icebreaker as capable as Coast
Guard Cutter MACKINAW (WLBB-30) is needed on the Great Lakes and the
Coast Guard should acquire this icebreaker as soon as possible.
