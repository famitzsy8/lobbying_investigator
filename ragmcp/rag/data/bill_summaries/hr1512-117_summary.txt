     <p><b>Climate Leadership and Environmental Action for our Nation&rsquo;s Future Act or the CLEAN Future Act</b></p> <p>This bill creates requirements and incentives to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.</p> <p>The bill establishes an interim goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to at least 50% below 2005 levels by 2030 as well as a national goal to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Each federal agency must develop a plan to achieve the goals.</p> <p>Beginning in 2023, retail electricity suppliers must provide an increasing percentage of electricity that is generated without the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere (zero-emission electricity). By 2035, the suppliers must provide 100% zero-emission electricity or demonstrate alternative means of compliance. For example, the suppliers may buy credits under a trading program that allows entities to buy, sell, and trade credits to demonstrate compliance.</p> <p>The bill also establishes a variety of requirements, programs, and incentives to reduce or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions by</p> <ul> <li>modernizing the electric grid and supporting clean energy microgrids;</li> <li>increasing the use of renewable energy and advanced nuclear power technologies;</li> <li>increasing energy efficiency in buildings, homes, and appliances;</li> <li>supporting clean transportation, including electric vehicles and related charging infrastructure;</li> <li>issuing greenhouse gas standards for certain vehicles, engines, and aircraft;</li> <li>promoting manufacturing and industrial decarbonization, including through buy-clean programs; </li> <li>supporting environmental justice efforts; and</li> <li>reducing methane, plastics, and super pollutants.</li> </ul>
