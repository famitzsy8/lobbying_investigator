     <p><b>Advanced Geothermal Innovation Leadership Act of 2019 or the AGILE Act of 2019</b></p> <p>This bill provides support for research and development of geothermal energy, including enhanced (i.e., engineered) geothermal systems.</p> <p>The bill reauthorizes through FY2024 funding to the Department of Energy (DOE) for (1) a research and development program for geothermal energy, and (2) a grant program for geothermal development in places with high utility prices.</p> <p>In addition, the bill directs DOE to</p> <ul> <li>support an initiative to adapt technologies from the oil and gas sector for use in geothermal energy development;</li> <li>support within the Geothermal Technologies Office a program of research, development, and demonstration in the secondary use of geothermal energy other than for electricity, direct use, or geothermal exchange heat pumps; </li> <li> carry out a competition that awards prizes for demonstrating the coproduction of critical minerals and geothermal energy; and</li> <li>support two Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy sites.</li> </ul> <p>This bill revises requirements governing the amount of renewable energy that the federal government must purchase. Specifically, the bill allows thermal energy and waste heat resources to qualify as renewable energy under the federal renewable energy purchase requirement.</p> <p>The Department of the Interior must establish a Geothermal Energy Permitting Coordination Program. Under the program, Interior must increase the expertise of officials administering and approving permits in order to improve coordination and reduce timelines for reviewing permits for geothermal energy projects on federal land.</p> <p>The U.S. Geological Survey must update its U.S. geothermal resource assessment.</p>
