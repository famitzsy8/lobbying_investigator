Based on my analysis, here are the key congressional members for this investigation:

1. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) - Committee Chair on Energy and Natural Resources, strong ties to oil industry
2. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY-14) - Vocal critic of fossil fuel lobbying, Green New Deal advocate  
3. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) - Receives significant energy industry donations, moderate on climate policy
4. Representative Dan Crenshaw (R-TX-2) - Former oil industry executive, sits on Energy Committee
5. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) - Financial Services Committee, focuses on corporate accountability

Here's my ranking of congressional members by relevance to this lobbying investigation:

| Member Name | State | Party | Committee Role | Influence Level |
|-------------|-------|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| Ted Cruz | TX | R | Energy Committee Chair | High - Industry connections |
| Joe Manchin | WV | D | Energy Committee Ranking | High - Moderate swing vote |
| AOC | NY-14 | D | Oversight Subcommittee | Medium - Anti-lobbying advocate |
| Dan Crenshaw | TX-2 | R | Energy Committee Member | Medium - Former industry executive |
| Lisa Murkowski | AK | R | Energy Committee Vice Chair | High - Alaska oil interests |

This concludes my analysis.
